microprocessor family.

@section Additional options for this module

This module provides the following additional options:

@table @option
    @item -swapixiy
        Swaps the usage of ix and iy registers. This is useful
        for compiling generic code that uses an index register that
        is reserved on the target machine.
    @item -8080
        Turns on 8080 compatibility mode. Any use of z80 (or higher)
        opcodes will result in an error being generated.
    @item -hd64180
        Turns on 64180 mode supporting additional 64180 opcodes.
    @item -gbz80
        Turns on gbz80 compatibility mode. Any use of non-supported
        opcodes will result in an error being generated.
    @item -rcm2000
    @item -rcm3000
    @item -rcm4000
         Turns on Rabbit compatibility mode, generating the correct
         codes for moved opcodes and supporting the additional Rabbit
         instructions. In this mode, 8 bit access to the 16 bit index
         registers is not permitted.
    @item -rcmemu
         Turns on emulation of some instructions which aren't available
         on the Rabbit processors.
    @item -z80asm
         Switches on z80asm mode. This translates ASMPC to $ and accepts
         some pseudo opcodes that z80asm supports. Most emulation of 
         z80asm directives is provided by the oldsyntax syntax module.

@section General

This backend accepts z80 family instructions in standard
Zilog syntax. Rabbit opcodes are accepted as defined in the 
publically available reference material from Rabbit Semiconductor,
with the exception that the @code{ljp} and @code{lcall} opcodes need
to be supplied with a 24 bit number rather than an 8 bit @code{xpc} and a
16 bit address.

The target address type is 16 bit.

Instructions consist of one up to six bytes and require no alignment.
There is also no alignment requirement for sections and data.

@section Extensions

This backend provides the following specific extensions:

@itemize @minus

@item Certain Rabbit opcodes can be prefixed by the @code{altd} and/or the
 @code{ioi}/@code{ioe} modifier.
 For details of which instructions these are valid for please
 see the documentation from Rabbit.

@item The parser understands a lo/hi-modifier to select low- or high-byte
 of a 16-bit word. The character @code{<} is used to select the low-byte
 and @code{>} for the high-byte. It has to be the first character before
 an expression.

@item When applying the operation @code{/256}, @code{%256} or @code{&256}
 on a label, an appropriate lo/hi-byte relocation will automatically be
 generated.

@end itemize

@section Optimisations

This backend supports the emulation of certain z80 instructions on the
Rabbit/gbz80 processor. These instructions are @code{rld}, @code{rrd},
@code{cpi}, @code{cpir}, @code{cpd} and @code{cpdr}.
The link stage should provide routines with the opcode name prefixed with
@code{rcmx_} (eg @code{rcmx_rld}) which implements the same functionality.
Example implementations are available within the z88dk CVS tree.

Additionally, for the Rabbit targets the missing call @code{cc}, opcodes
will be emulated.

@section Known Problems

    Some known problems of this module at the moment:

@itemize @minus

@item Not all RCM4000 opcodes are supported (@code{llcall}, @code{lljp}
 are not available).

@item Parser considers an expression starting by @code{(} as being a memory
indirection even if there are operations after the closing @code{)}.
As long as the bug is not corrected you should put operations before the first
@code{(}.
