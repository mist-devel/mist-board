@subsection Optimization options
@table @option
    @item -no-opt
        Disable all optimizations. Can be seen as a main switch to ignore
        all other optimization options on the command line and in the source.

    @item -opt-allbra
        When specified the assembler will also try to optimize branch
        instructions which already have a valid size extension.
        This option is automatically enabled in @option{-phxass} mode.

    @item -opt-brajmp
        Translate relative branch instructions, whose destination is in a
        different section, into absolute jump instructions.

    @item -opt-clr
        Enables optimization from @code{MOVE #0,<ea>} into @code{CLR <ea>}.
        Note that @code{CLR} will execute a read-modify-write cycle
        on the MC68000.

    @item -opt-fconst
        Floating point constants are loaded with the lowest precision
        possible. This means that @code{FMOVE.D #1.0,FP0} would be
        optimized to @code{FMOVE.S #1.0,FP0}, because it is faster and
        shorter at the same precision. The optimization will be performed
        on all FPU instructions with immediate addressing mode.
        When an FDIV-family instruction (@code{FSDIV}, @code{FDDIV},
        @code{FSGLDIV}) is detected it will additionally be checked if the
        immediate constant is a power of 2 and then converted into
        @code{FMUL #1/c,FPn}.

    @item -opt-lsl
        Allows optimization of @code{LSL} into @code{ADD}. This optimization
        may modify the V-flag, which might not be intended.

    @item -opt-movem
        Enables optimization from @code{MOVEM <ea>,Rn} into
        @code{MOVE <ea>,Rn} (or the other way around). This optimization
        will modify the flags, when the destination is no address
        register.

    @item -opt-mul
        Immediate multplication factors, which are a power of two (from 2
        to 256), are optimized to shifts. Multiplications with zero are
        replaced by a @code{MOVEQ #0,Dn}, with -1 are replaced by a
        @code{NEG.L Dn} and with 1 by @code{EXT.L Dn} or @code{TST.L Dn}
        (long-form). Not all optimizations are available for all cpu types
        (e.g. @code{MULU.W} can only be optimized on ColdFire by using
        the @code{MVZ.W} instruction.
        This optimization will leave the flags in a different state as
        can normally be expected after a multiplication instruction, and
        the size of the optimized code may be bigger than before in a few
        situations (e.g. @code{MULS.W #4,Dn}). The latter will additionally
        require the @option{-opt-speed} flag.

    @item -opt-div
        Unsigned immediate divisors, which are a power of two (from 2 to 256),
        are optimized to shifts. Divisions by 1 are replaced by @code{TST.L Dn}
        (32-bit) or @code{MVZ.W Dn,Dn} (16-bit, ColdFire only). Divisions by
        -1 are replaced by @code{NEG.L Dn} (32-bit) or by a combination of
        @code{NEG.W Dn} and @code{MVZ.W Dn,Dn} (16-bit, ColdFire only).
        This optimization will leave the flags in a different state as
        can normally be expected after a division instruction.

    @item -opt-pea
        Enables optimization from @code{MOVE #x,-(SP)} into @code{PEA x}.
        This optimization will leave the flags unmodified, which might
        not be intended.

    @item -opt-speed
        Optimize for speed, even if this would increase code size.
        It enables optimization of @code{ASL.W #2,Dn} into two
        @code{ADD.W Dn,Dn} instructions. Or @code{MULS.W #-4,Dn} into
        @code{EXT.L Dn + ASL.L #2,Dn + NEG.L Dn}.

    @item -opt-st
        Enables optimization from @code{MOVE.B #-1,<ea>} into @code{ST <ea>}.
        This optimization will leave the flags unmodified, which might
        not be intended.

    @item -showcrit
        Print all critical optimizations which have side effects. Among
        those are @code{-opt-lsl}, @code{-opt-mul}, @code{-opt-st},
        @code{-opt-pea}, @code{-opt-movem} and @code{-opt-clr}.

    @item -showopt
        Print all optimizations and translations vasm is doing
        (same as @code{opt ow+}).
@end table

In its default setting (no @option{-devpac} or @option{-phxass} option)
vasm performs the following optimizations:
@itemize @minus
@item Absolute to PC-relative.
@item Branches without explicit size.
@item Displacements (32 to 16 bit, @code{(0,An)} to @code{(An)}, etc).
@item Optimize floating point constants to the lowest possible precision.
@item Many instruction optimizations which are safe.
@end itemize

@subsection Other options
@table @option
    @item -sdreg=<n>
        Set the small data base register to @code{An}. <n> is valid
        between 2 and 6.

    @item -elfregs
        Register names are preceded by a '%' to prevent confusion
        with symbol names.

    @item -conv-brackets
        Brackets (@code{'['} and @code{']'}) in an operand are automatically
        converted into parentheses (@code{'('} and @code{')'}) as long as
        the CPU is 68000 or 68010. This is a compatibility option for some
        old assemblers.

    @item -rangewarnings
        Values which are out of range usually produce an error. With this
        option the errors 2026, 2030, 2033 and 2037 will be displayed as
        a warning, allowing the user to create an object file.

    @item -phxass
        PhxAss-compatibilty mode. The "current PC symbol" (e.g. @code{*} in
        mot-syntax module) is set to the instruction's address + 2 whenever
        an instruction is parsed.
        According to the current cpu setting the symbols @code{__CPU},
        @code{__FPU} and @code{__MMU} are defined.
        @code{JMP/JSR (label,PC)} will never be optimized (into a branch,
        for example).
        It will also automatically enable @option{-opt-allbra}.

    @item -devpac
        All options are initially set to be Devpac compatible. Which means
        that all optimizations are disabled, no debugging symbols will be
        written and vasm will warn about any optimization being done.
        Other options are the same as vasm's defaults.
        The symbol @code{__G2} is defined, which contains information
        about the selected cpu type.

@section General

This backend accepts M68k and CPU32 instructions as described in
Mototola's M68000 family Programmer's Reference Manual. Additionally
it supports ColdFire instructions as described in Motorola's ColdFire
Microprocessor Family Programmer's Reference Manual.

The syntax for the scale factor in ColdFire @code{MAC} instructions is
@code{<<} for left- and @code{>>} for right-shift. The scale factor may be
appended as an optional operand, when needed.
Example: @code{mac d0.l,d1.u,<<}.

The mask flag in @code{MAC} instructions is written as @code{&} and is
appended directly to the effective address operand. Example:
@code{mac d0,d1,(a0)&,d2}.

The target address type is 32bit.

Default alignment for instructions is 2 bytes. Sections will be aligned
to 8 bytes by default. The default alignment for data is 2 bytes, when
the data size is larger than 8 bits.

Depending on the selected cpu type the @code{__VASM} symbol will have
a value defined by the following bits:
@table @code
@item bit 0
      MC68000 instruction set. Also used by MC6830x, MC68322, MC68356.

@item bit 18
      ColdFire MMU instructions.
@end table


@section Extensions

This backend extends the selected syntax module by the following
directives:

@table @code
@item .sdreg <An>
      Equivalents to @code{near <An>}.

@item basereg <expression>,<An>
      Starts a block of base-relative addressing through register @code{An}
      (remember that @code{A7} is not allowed as a base register).
      The programmer has to make sure that <expression> is placed
      into @code{An} first, while the assembler automatically subtracts
      <expression>, which is usually a program label with an optional offset,
      from each displacement in a @code{(d,An)} addressing mode.
      @code{basereg} has priority over the @code{near} directive. Its effect
      can be suspended with the @code{endb} directive.
      It is allowed to use several base registers in parallel.

@item cpu32
      Generate code for the CPU32 family.

@item endb <An>
      Ends a @code{basereg} block and suspends its effect onto the
      specified base register @code{An}. It may be reused with a different
      base expression thereafter (refer to @code{basereg}).

@item far
      Disables small data (base-relative) mode. All data references
      will be absolute.

@item fpu <cpID>
      Enables 68881/68882 FPU code generation. The <cpID> is inserted
      into the FPU instructions to select the correct coprocessor. Note
      that <cpID> is always 1 for the on-chip FPUs in the 68040 and
      68060. A <cpID> of zero will disable FPU code generation.

@item initnear
      Initializes the selected small data register. In contrast to PhxAss,
      where this directive comes from, just a reference to
      @code{_LinkerDB} is generated, which has to be resolved by a linker.

@item machine <cpu_type>
      Makes the assembler generate code for <cpu_type>, which can be
      the following: @code{68000}, @code{68010}, @code{68020}, @code{68030},
      @code{68040}, @code{68060}, @code{68851}, @code{68881}, @code{68882},
      @code{cpu32}. And various ColdFire CPUs, starting with @code{5...}.

@item mc68000
      Generate code for the MC68000 CPU.

@item mc68010
      Generate code for the MC68010 CPU.

@item mc68020
      Generate code for the MC68020 CPU.

@item mc68030
      Generate code for the MC68030 CPU.

@item mc68040
      Generate code for the MC68040 CPU.

@item mc68060
      Generate code for the MC68060 CPU.

@item mcf5...
      Generate code for a ColdFire CPU. The recognized models are listed
      in the assembler-options section.

@item near [<An>]
      Enables small data (base-relative) mode and sets the base register
      to @code{An}. @code{near} without an argument will reactivate a
      previously defined small data mode, which might be switched off
      by a @code{far} directive.

@item opt <option>[,<option>...]
      Sets Devpac-compatible options. When option @option{-phxass} is
      given, then it will parse PhxAss options (which is discouraged,
      so there is no detailed description here).
      The supported Devpac2-style options are always suffixed by a
      @code{+} or @code{-} to enable or disable the option:
   @table @code
      @item a
        Automatically optimize absolute to PC-relative references.
        Default is off in Devpac-comptability mode, otherwise on.
      @item c
        Case-sensitivity for all symbols, instructions and macros.
        Default is on.
      @item d
        Include all symbols for debugging in the output file.
        Default is off in Devpac-comptability mode, otherwise on.
      @item o
        Enable all optimizations (o1 to o12), or disable all optimizations.
        Default is that all are disabled in Devpac-compatibility mode and
        enabled otherwise.
        When running in native vasm mode this option will also control
        the following safe vasm-specific optimizations (see below):
        @code{og}, @code{of}, @code{oj}.
      @item o1
        Optimize branches without an explicit size extension.
      @item o2
        Standard displacement optimizations (e.g. @code{(0,An) -> (An)}).
      @item o3
        Optimize absolute addresses to short words.
      @item o4
        Optimize @code{move.l} to @code{moveq}.
      @item o5
        Optimize @code{add #x} and @code{sub #x} into their quick forms.
      @item o6
        No effect in vasm.
      @item o7
        Convert @code{bra.b} to @code{nop}, when branching to the next
        instruction.
      @item o8
        Optimize 68020+ base displacements to 16 bit.
      @item o9
        Optimize 68020+ outer displacements to 16 bit.
      @item o10
        Optimize @code{add/sub #x,An} to @code{lea}.
      @item o11
        Optimize @code{lea (d,An),An} to @code{addq/subq}.
      @item o12
        Optimize @code{<op>.l #x,An} to @code{<op>.w #x,An}.
      @item ow
        Show all optimizations being peformed.
        Default is on in Devpac-compatibility mode, otherwise off.
      @item p
        Check if code is position independant. This will cause an error on
        each relocation being required.
        Default is off.
      @item s
        Include symbols in listing file.
        Default is on.
      @item t
        Check size and type of all expressions.
        Default is on.
      @item w
        Show assembler warnings.
        Default is on.
      @item x
        Only include xdefs in the output file (no symbols).
        This flag has always the inverted state of @code{d}.
   @end table

   Also the following Devpac3-style options are supported:
   @table @code
      @item autopc
        Corresponds to @code{a+}.
      @item case
        Corresponds to @code{c+}.

      @item noxdebug
        Corresponds to @code{x-}.
      @item p=<type>[/<type>]
        Sets the CPU type to any model vasm supports (original Devpac3
        only allowed 68000-68040, 68332, 68881, 68882 and 68851).
   @end table

   The following options are vasm specific and should not be used when
   writing portable source. Using @code{opt o+} in Devpac mode does not
   enable any of these options.
   @table @code
      @item oc
        Enable optimizations to @code{CLR} (refer to @code{-opt-clr}).
      @item od
        Enable optimization of divisions into shifts (refer to
        @code{-opt-div}).
      @item of
        Enable immediate float constant optimizations (refer to
        @code{-opt-fconst}).
      @item og
        Enable generic vasm optimizations. All optimizations which cannot
        be controlled by another option.
      @item oj
        Enable branch to jump optimizations (refer to @code{-opt-brajmp}).
      @item ol
        Enable shift optimizations to @code{ADD} (refer to @code{-opt-lsl}).
      @item om
        Enable @code{MOVEM} optimizations (refer to @code{-opt-movem}).
      @item op
        Enable optimizations to @code{PEA} (refer to @code{-opt-pea}).
      @item os
        Optimize for speed before optimizing for size (refer to
        @code{-opt-speed}).
      @item ot
        Enable optimizations to @code{ST} (refer to @code{-opt-st}).
      @item ox
        Enable optimization of multiplications into shifts
        (refer to @code{-opt-mul}).
   @end table
   The default state is 'off' for all those vasm specific options.
@end table

The following directives are only available for the Motorola syntax
module:
